abstract = {Most aviation communities have increasing concerns about the environmental impacts, which are directly linked to health issues for local residents near the airport. In this study, the environmental impact of different departure procedures using the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) was analyzed. First, actual operational data were compiled at Gimpo International Airport (March 20, 2017) from an open source. Two modifications were made in the AEDT to model the operational circumstances better and the preliminary AEDT simulations were performed according to the acquired operational procedures. Simulated noise results showed good agreements with noise measurement data at specific locations. Second, a multi-objective optimization of departure procedures was performed for the Boeing 737–800. Four design variables were selected and AEDT was linked to a variety of advanced design methods. The results showed that takeoff thrust had the greatest influence and it was found that fuel burn and noise had an inverse relationship. Two points representing each fuel burn and noise optimum on the Pareto front were parsed and run in AEDT to compare with the baseline. The results showed that the noise optimum case reduced Sound Exposure Level 80-dB noise exposure area by approximately 5% while the fuel burn optimum case reduced total fuel burn by 1% relative to the baseline for aircraft-level analysis.},

    abstract = { As the Korean government agencies have recently announced the first official road map for urban air mobility (UAM) with the aim of introducing a new aviation transportation system, many companies in South Korea have initiated projects to design airspace infrastructure for UAM operations at the early stage of development. Given that the agencies tentatively plan to expand UAM to regional air mobility (RAM) operations at the mature stage of development, this research specifically focuses on establishing airspace infrastructure for upcoming RAM operations in South Korea. The proposed methodology leverages three different algorithms: 1) a partitioning-based clustering algorithm for placing vertiport locations, 2) a density-based clustering algorithm for predicting areas of convective weather, and 3) the Latin hypercube sampling-based probabilistic road map (LHS-based PRM) algorithm for generating an adaptive airspace network. The resulting airspace, constructed by the proposed methodology, takes into account airspace restriction areas such as prohibited areas or military operation areas. The main contribution of this research is to employ a data-driven approach using machine learning and LHS-based PRM algorithms to dynamically establish airspace infrastructure to be potentially used for upcoming RAM operations in South Korea. }
